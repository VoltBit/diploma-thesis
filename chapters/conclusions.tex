\chapter{Conclusions}

To sum up all the aspects presented in the previous chapters, the framework proposal is more of an architectural proposal accompanied by a functional but limited software representation. The solution focuses on the fundamental requirement - being able to validate a Linux distribution based on a specification - and offers the functionality through a flexible model and simple design. The abstraction of specifications, quantification of compliance and the extensive use of open-source tools to create a convenient and useful framework is the main achievement of the project.

The technical implementation uses lightweight, efficient and extensible open source projects. 

Ellida is not supposed to be a more efficient solution, but to provide high level features
